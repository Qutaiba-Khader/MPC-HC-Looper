			;		- Delete the old array (uninitialize it from _GUIListViewEx
			;		- Reinitialize the array (check the search functions to see how to do this) to _GUIListViewEx
			;		- Re-display the events list with the new filename in place
			;		- Re-open that event one more time, this time with the (found) file
